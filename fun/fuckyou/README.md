# 🐧 Bash Bouncing Animation



A silly little terminal animation — because why not?

This Bash script brings a couple of frames of ASCII art to life with a *bouncing effect*. It's completely useless, mildly hypnotic, and oddly satisfying. Perfect for when you're pretending to be productive.

## 🤹 What It Does

- Clears your terminal.
- Shows two frames of some funky ASCII magic.
- Loops forever.
- That’s it. No deeper meaning.

## 💡 How to Use

Just run the script:

```bash
chmod +x bounce.sh
./bounce.sh
````

Sit back and enjoy the terminal bounce.

## 🚀 Why?

Because sometimes, you just need a little dancing ASCII art in your life.

## 🛑 How to Stop It

It loops forever. Smash `Ctrl + C` to escape the loop. (Or embrace it.)
